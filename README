# Spew Build

Spew build is some shell utilities to help build _semi-reproducable_
appliances and run them with `systemd-nspawn`


## Examples

```
$ spew-build riak/2.1.0
...
=> Running /data/src/lafka/spew-targets/dummy/0.0.2/build.sh
=> Build dummy/0.0.2:480530 in /tmp/tmp.QtSrjvU23J
=> Copying /tmp/tmp.QtSrjvU23J -> /home/user/.spew/builds/dummy/0.0.2/02cc83/480530
=> Build was successfull
$ spew-build run riak-local riak/2.1.0
```
